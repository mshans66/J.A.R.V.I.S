Hi! I am Neel Kumar and I have made JARVIS(Just A Rather Very Intelligent System).
It is a voice assistant which helps me improve my work efficiency while creating any project or doing some other
work on my laptop.
I have program it in such a way that it works only on my laptop.
It can do the following tasks:-
1.) It Greets me according to current hour going on.
2.) It searches anything from wikipedia for eg.-if we search "sharukh khan wikipedia" then it grabs information
from wikipedia and speak the desired results.
3.) It can search those website which I use frequently and can search total 30 websites
for eg.- if wi say "open facebook", then it opens facebook for me.
4.) It tells me current time like if I say "tell the time", then it tells time to me.
5.) It can open programs which I use most like pycharm, python IDE, whatsapp etc.
6.) It can talk to me like my friend.
7.) It can search anything on my default web browser for eg.- if I say "I want to find something" and then give
it command like "What is capital of India" then it tells me the answer of that question.
8.) It can open my favourite you tube channels like if I say "expert I youtube" then it opens that.
9.) Just by saying "tell me a joke" it tells me very funny jokes
10.) It can play my favourite musics and songs like if I say "play music", then it plays music or if I say
"play first song" or "play second song", then it plays likewise.
11.) It can send email to others and that's true!!!
12.) Using wolframalpha module it can tell answer to any question whether it's related to mathematics, science
and technology, society and culture or everyday life.
13.) It can also tell latest news from different news media companies like hindustan times, zee news etc.
